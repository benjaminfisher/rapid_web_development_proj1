# Working Directory

I thought it might be better to keep our folder of working markup and front-end
distinct from the directory I'll need to interact with to setup the framework.

Go ahead and use this working directory for all the assets, images, css, and js
and I can pull from here and push live architecture to the main directory more
easily. 101611 jeffreyhogan
