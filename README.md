Added the skeleton framework in for the Ruby/Sinatra App! It only has
a stripped out app structure at the moment and a placeholder DOM I was using
for testing. If you have Ruby and Sinatra installed you should be able to pull
   the new files down, CD into the project directory and type 'ruby
   application.rb' NO QUOTES. Then go to your browser and navigate to
   localhost:4567 (or whatever port your sinatra is running WEBRICK on). When Jake gives the go-ahead on his template I will create the views and .erb files needed for the templated parts of the site.  - jeffreyhogan 102211
